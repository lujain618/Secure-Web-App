#  Insecure Escape Room Booking Web App

This is a deliberately insecure web application built using **PHP** and **MySQL** to demonstrate common web vulnerabilities. 
It mimics an escape room booking platform with a customer and admin interface.

>  WARNING: This application is **intentionally vulnerable** and **must never be deployed to a production server**.

---

##  Features

- User registration and login
- Browse and book escape rooms
- Admin panel to manage bookings (accessible by bypass)
- Ask-a-question popup feature

---

##  Implemented Vulnerabilities

### 1. **SQL Injection**
- Vulnerable login and registration forms.
- Example: `email = ' OR 1=1 --` lets attackers bypass login.

### 2. **Weak Password Storage**
- Passwords are hashed using `MD5` (not secure).
- Admin user in DB was originally stored in plaintext and then hashed with MD5.

### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- A popup form on `home.php` allows users to submit a question.
- Submitted input is displayed **without sanitization**, allowing scripts like:
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
